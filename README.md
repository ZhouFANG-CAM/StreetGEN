**(2022.07.04)** The manuscript entitled “A framework for human-computer interactive street network design based on a multi-stage deep learning approach” has been accepted for publication in Computers, Environment and Urban System.

### Paper highlights:

- Complement the procedural and learning-based computer-aided frameworks for street network design.

- Improve conventional, end-to-end deep learning structure to a multi-stage one.

- Develop an HCI system for interactive and progressive street network design.

- Provide more realistic planning options and enrich alternatives in the early stages of urban planning and design.
